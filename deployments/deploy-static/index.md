## The first season of my Cloud Architect journey
> season-o1: creatorP mini-projects

Navigating the landscape of Cloud Computing and Cloud-native Architectures is a continous exiting journey and Cloud Platforms such as the  
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) have been a ***great co-pilot***.

Learning Kubernetes concepts from the Kubernetes docs <https://kubernetes.io/> has been a beautiful experience thus far. I am a proud member of  
the online Kubernetes open-source community where we share and learn cool stuff.

## Continuous Learning

Discovering and learning new technologies everyday is a competent skill I am evolving at everyday.

Some new technologies I am excited to leverage and continously learn include:  
- Knative <https://knative.dev/docs/>  
*Knative* is an Open-Scource Enterprise-level solution to build Serverless and Event Driven Applications on modern Severless Architectures
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) <https://aws.amazon.com/>
